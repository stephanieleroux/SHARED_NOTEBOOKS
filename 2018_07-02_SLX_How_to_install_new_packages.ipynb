    "# How to install an external package on the jupyter notebook server (MEOM group)\n",

    "\t- This tuto aims to illustrate how to install a new external* package on the jupyter notebook server. (*) external in the sense that it is not available via conda.\n",
    "\t- We’re taking here the package [xscale](https://github.com/serazing/xscale) developped by G. Sérazin as an example.\n",
    "\t- It is very much recommended (not to say necessary) to __create your own conda environment__ (if you don’t have one already): this is what  steps 1.1 and 1.2 do. \n",

    "* You might find that other dependencies need to be installed for your external package to work. In this case, proceed as in step 1.2 for those dependencies.\n",
